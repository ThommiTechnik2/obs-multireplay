// dock-metrics.hpp — the panel's sizes, worked out with no Qt in them.
//
// WHY THIS IS A FILE OF ITS OWN. Every arrangement question in dock-layout.hpp
// is really an arithmetic question — is the panel narrow enough to be a
// column, how much height is the monitoring row allowed, how big does a camera
// tile come out — and the answers are pure int/double work. They used to live
// in dock-layout.hpp/.cpp, which include Qt, so the standalone unit tests
// (compiled with nothing but a C++20 compiler) could not reach a single one:
// the only things that exercised them were a full panel and a second-renderer run, and
// neither fails a build. Moved here, they cost a header include and gain a
// CTest.
//
// ONE COPY: dock-layout.hpp includes this and re-exports the QSize overload of
// panelModeFor, so the panel and the tests read the same numbers.

// arrangement this number chooses, so feeding it back makes a pass decide from
// whatever the widget happened to be mid-settle — measured once at 100 px, which
// picked an arrangement of 78 px stamps. What the splitter is willing to give
// depends on the panel and a constant, so it is the same answer on every pass.

// splitter divides WIDTH, not height, and until this function existed NOTHING

// explicitly hands Short back with "a height means nothing here" and stops,
// leaving a QSplitter with only its stretch factors (3:2) to go on. Content
// changes on the LEFT side (a section gaining a row, a rank moving a block
// onto a different packed line) can shift where that stretch-driven default
// converges even though nothing on the right changed at all — measured: a
// height-only edit to the key strip moved this divider 28 px, enough to push
// "Live" in the toolbar down to its CSS floor (44 px) instead of its own
// word's width (85), rendering it clipped rather than merely tight.
//
// So this divider gets the same treatment as the height one: left alone once
// the operator has dragged it (that check happens at the call site, same as
// bodyChosen/splitChosen elsewhere), it otherwise guarantees the RIGHT pane
// (the toolbar + event list) its own preferred width before the left column
// gets whatever is left — floored at the left column's own minimum, since
// giving away more than exists is not "guaranteeing" anything.

// designed, chosen by the shape of the room the panel was given.
//
//   Wide   undocked, full screen, or a big dock: pictures across the top, list
//          under them, the control strip in two macro-rows.
//   Short  docked UNDER the OBS preview — wide and shallow. Stacking pictures
//          on top of the list cannot afford both, so they go side by side.
//   Tall   docked down one SIDE — a single narrow column. The multiview becomes
//          a filmstrip and the control strip becomes a stack.
//

// arrangement's own minimum height, or the panel can never get short enough to
// be told to change: it sits at its floor, still wide, refusing to shrink. When
// the mark keys went to three rows and the speed dial grew an export key under
// it, that floor went from 422 to 471 and crossed the line — measured, and the

//
// So this is not a taste number: it is "the wide arrangement no longer fits".
//
// AND A CONSTANT CANNOT SAY THAT, which is the second time this trap was
// sprung and the reason it is now measured instead. The wide arrangement's
// floor is not one number: it depends on the WIDTH, because below a certain
// one the strip's six sections stop fitting across three lanes and fold onto
// more lines. Measured on the panel this was written for: 553 px at 1920 wide,
// 651 px at 1400. A threshold of 540 is under BOTH, so a docked panel dragged
// as short as it will go stops at its floor, still wide, and the arrangement
// that would have fitted is never reached. From the operator's chair the short
// arrangement simply does not exist.
